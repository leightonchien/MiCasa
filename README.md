# MiCasa

## Project Description

MiCasa is a mobile app that helps users to find available housing rental units without having to constantly check rental websites.
An user can simply set preferences to what they look for in a rental, and forget it.
Walk around the neighbourhood, if any listings match your preferences, 
it will push notify the user providing the listing details and can chat with the owner directly.

## Initial Setup
To run the following project on your machine please follow the steps below:  
### Backend setup:
1. Create an <code> .env </code> in the main backend directory where you'll be providing the required API Keys. 
2. Obtain an API key from **Google map** https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started Place these in the ```.env ``` file you created in the backend. 
You will need to use the same Google map API Key for the Frontend setup as well so keep this handy for now.
### Frontend setup:
3. Create an <code> .env </code> in the main frontend directory where you'll be providing the required API Keys. 
4. Take the **Google map**  API key you obtained earlier for the backend setup and put this in the .env file. 



## Getting Started 
1. Install all frontend dependencies while in the main frontend directory.
